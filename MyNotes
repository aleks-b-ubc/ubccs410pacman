Self notes and ideas.
What we got: 	Custom packet for any data.
				Co-Ordinator is the HOST. He is also PACMAN.
				Person joining is going to be a HumanGhost
				
Decision: In multiplayer waiting area. Make the keys show: "H" to host the game.
			"C" to connect to game.
			If one selects host - it makes him the controller and the PacMan
			If one selects to connect - they need to type the IP to which to connect
			The connection port will be hard coded.
			For now we will make this 2 player. 3 player can be added later.
			FOR NOW WILL HARD CODE ALL IP to LOCALHOST!!
